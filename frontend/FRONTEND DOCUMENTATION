FRONTEND DOCUMENTATION
    document all what you've recently learned in here that is essential for this web project:

Felix: in vite.config.js, inside the defineConfig({}) i added server and inside port i manually change the port of the front end to 3000
    =>  server: {
            port: 3000
        }


Felix: inside of the vite.config.js i added proxy so that frontend can interact to my backend server port which is the address of my backend is https://localhost:5000 and will start on empty forward slash '/'
    =>  proxy: {
            '/': 'https://localhost:5000'
        }
