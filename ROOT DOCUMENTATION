FRONTEND TO BACKEND Integration

for frontend to have an interaction to backend, I installed from the root directory (MangaWebSystem) 
    => npm install concurrently --save-dev

then i added inside of the package.json (MangaWebSystem/package.json)
    => "dev": "concurrently \" npm run dev --prefix frontend\" \"npm run dev --prefix backend\""

so that i can run both from frontend to backend localhost port
    => (frontend run on https://localhost:3000 and backend run on https://localhost:5000)
